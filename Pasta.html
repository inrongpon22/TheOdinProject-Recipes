    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There is nothing nicer than the flavor of fresh tomatoes. You can use
      canned, but the trouble you take to prepare this dish is worth it. You
      prepare the sauce while the pasta is cooking, no long hours of waiting.
      Great if you want meatless pasta.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (ounce) package of angle hair pasta</li>
      <li>2 pounds tomatoes</li>
      <li>4 cloves crushed garlic</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of chopped fresh basil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place tomatoes in a kettle, and cover with cold water. Bring
        just to the boil. Pour off water, and cover again with cold water. Peel.
        Cut into small pieces.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al
        dente.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet or saute pan, saute the garlic in enough
        olive oil to cover the bottom of the pan. The garlic should just become
        opaque, not brown. Stir in the tomato paste. Immediately stir in the
        tomatoes, and salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and simmer until the pasta
        is ready; add the basil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain the pasta, but do not rinse in cold water. Toss with a
        couple of tablespoons of olive oil, and then mix into the sauce. Reduce
        the heat as low as possible. Keep warm, uncovered, for about 10 minutes
        when it is ready to serve. Garnish generously with fresh Parmesan
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        VARIATIONS: Saute fresh quartered mushrooms with the garlic, or
        add shoestring zucchini along with the tomato.
      </li>
    </ol>
